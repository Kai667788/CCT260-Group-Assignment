            <p>The student lets go of the locked door handle and walks back into the studio.</p>
            <p>At the front desk, an open sketchbook is waiting. Every page is filled with rough perspective drawings of corridors and doors, as if someone has been designing a maze.</p>
            <p>Beside the sketchbook, a tablet suddenly wakes up by itself. Large blue numbers appear on the screen:</p>
            <p class="timer-text"><strong>00:09:59</strong></p>
            <p>The sound is silent, but the message is clear: there is a time limit.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Visual “clue” row: timer + wall note -->
        <div class="clue-row">
            <div class="timer-box">
                <p class="box-label">Countdown</p>
                <p class="box-value">00:09:59</p>

                <!-- animated bar – shows tension, not a real timer -->
                <div class="timer-strip">
                    <div class="timer-strip-fill"></div>

            <div class="note-box">
                <p class="box-label">Wall note</p>
                <p class="note-text">“EVERY DOOR IS A DECISION.”</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Second narration block leading into the hallway -->
        <div class="narration smaller-narration">
            <p>The blue light from the tablet spills across the desk and out into the room. It picks out a faint outline in the back wall.</p>
            <p>Right between two rows of desks, a narrow door is now standing slightly open. It was not open a moment ago.</p>
            <p>The student takes a breath, closes the sketchbook, and steps away from the desk. There is really only one thing left to do.</p>
