            <p>It’s almost midnight in the campus design studio. The computers hum quietly. Most of the lights are off.</p>
            <p>A student finally finishes their last web design project of the semester. As they walk toward the exit, they hear a soft <em>click</em>.</p>
            <p>The door handle doesn’t move. The studio is locked from the outside.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, a monitor flickers on by itself. Slowly, a line of text types across the screen:</p>
            <p class="monitor-text"><strong>“IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE, FIND THE HIDDEN EXIT.”</strong></p>
