			<p>Each screen shows a different scene from the student’s life: old projects, unfinished ideas, designs that were never presented.</p>
			<p>On the largest screen, new text appears:</p>
			<p class="screen-text"><strong>“YOU DIDN’T ESCAPE. YOU UNLOCKED A NEW LEVEL.”</strong></p>

			<p>The door behind the student closes, but this room doesn’t feel like a prison.</p>
			<p>It feels like the beginning of something unknown.</p>
			<p>The student smiles, sits down at the central desk, and reaches for the keyboard.</p>
