            <p>The hallway is narrow and quiet. The only sound is the distant ticking of the countdown.</p>
            <p>At the end of the hall, there are two doors facing each other.</p>
            <p>The door on the left is labeled in clear white letters: “EXIT.” It's the slightest bit ajar, and a soft light peeks out from the crack.</p>
            <p>The door on the right is marked with a simple question mark: “?." Your hands itch to turn the knob.</p>
            <p>A small speaker in the ceiling crackles to life:</p>
            <p>“One door leads you out. The other leads you deeper. You have to choose before the timer hits zero.”</p>
            <p>The student hesitates for a moment… then reaches for a handle.</p>
